S = Symbol
A = Atom

More complex example: 
- S sentence, NP noun phrase, VP verb phrase, A article, N noun , PN proper noun and V verb



grammars
S -> NP VP
NP -> A N | PN
VP -> V | V NP
A -> a | the
N -> cat | student | moon
PN -> Spot | Carl
V -> sees | admires

"the cat sees Spot" is a valid statement

using **parse tree**
A parse tree has the starting symbol S at its top
Every node in the rtee is either a symbol or an atom

Each symbol node has childrem representing a sequence of items that can be derived from that symbol
Each atom has no children
